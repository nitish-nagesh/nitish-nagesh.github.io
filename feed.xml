However, with great power comes great responsibility—especially when dealing with sensitive health data and life-critical decisions.</p> <h2 id="the-trust-challenge-in-healthcare-ai">The Trust Challenge in Healthcare AI</h2> <p>Healthcare AI systems face unique challenges that go beyond traditional machine learning applications:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Bias amplification</strong>: Historical healthcare disparities can be perpetuated by AI systems</li> <li><strong>Explainability requirements</strong>: Clinicians need to understand AI recommendations</li> <li><strong>Causal reasoning</strong>: Correlation doesn’t imply causation, especially in health outcomes</li> <li><strong>Fairness across populations</strong>: Ensuring equitable outcomes across diverse patient groups</li> </ul> <h2 id="my-research-approach-causal-fairness">My Research Approach: Causal Fairness</h2> <p>In my recent work on <strong>FairCauseSyn</strong>, we developed a framework for generating causally fair synthetic data using large language models. This approach addresses a critical gap in healthcare AI: how do we create training data that doesn’t perpetuate existing biases?</p> <h3 id="key-insights">Key Insights:</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Causal graphs matter</strong>: Understanding the causal relationships between variables is crucial for fair AI</li> <li><strong>Synthetic data can help</strong>: When real data is biased, carefully generated synthetic data can provide fairer training sets</li> <li><strong>LLMs as data generators</strong>: Large language models can be fine-tuned to generate causally consistent synthetic data</li> </ol> <h2 id="practical-applications">Practical Applications</h2> <p>This research has direct implications for:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Clinical decision support systems</strong></li> <li><strong>Drug discovery and development</strong></li> <li><strong>Personalized treatment recommendations</strong></li> <li><strong>Health outcome predictions</strong></li> </ul> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>The future of healthcare AI lies in systems that are not just accurate, but also fair, explainable, and causally sound. As we continue to develop these technologies, it’s crucial that we prioritize patient safety and equity.</p> <hr/> <p><em>This post is part of my ongoing research on trustworthy AI for health applications.

While CSrankings lists professors, their research areas, and links to their websites, there was no consolidated list that contained all potential PhD openings at universities like UC Irvine.</p> <h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2> <p>Prospective graduate students face several challenges when researching PhD opportunities:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Scattered information</strong>: Faculty openings are posted across multiple platforms</li> <li><strong>Time-consuming research</strong>: Students must visit individual faculty websites</li> <li><strong>Missed opportunities</strong>: Important deadlines and openings can be overlooked</li> <li><strong>Limited diversity</strong>: Lack of centralized information disproportionately affects underrepresented students</li> </ul> <h2 id="our-solution">Our Solution</h2> <p>Together with my fellow Ph.D. student <a href="https://github.com/nitish-nagesh/uci-ics-phd-positions">Alagappan Ramanathan</a>, we created a comprehensive resource for UC Irvine’s Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences PhD positions.</p> <h3 id="what-we-built">What We Built</h3> <p>Our <a href="https://github.com/nitish-nagesh/uci-ics-phd-positions">GitHub repository</a> provides:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Consolidated listings</strong> of all PhD openings at UC Irvine ICS</li> <li><strong>Faculty research areas</strong> and contact information</li> <li><strong>Application deadlines</strong> and requirements</li> <li><strong>Direct links</strong> to faculty profiles and research groups</li> </ul> <p>This resource is particularly relevant for prospective students applying for Fall 2025 admissions.</p> <h2 id="impact-and-mission">Impact and Mission</h2> <p>Our mission is to <strong>improve access to information for prospective students</strong>, thereby contributing to a more diverse applicant pool in computer science graduate programs.</p> <h3 id="key-benefits">Key Benefits:</h3> <ol> <li><strong>Democratized access</strong>: All students, regardless of background, can easily find opportunities</li> <li><strong>Time savings</strong>: Reduces research time from weeks to hours</li> <li><strong>Comprehensive coverage</strong>: No missed opportunities due to scattered information</li> <li><strong>Community building</strong>: Encourages collaboration across campus organizations</li> </ol> <h2 id="community-support">Community Support</h2> <p>We’re grateful for the support and feedback from:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Sara Heimann</strong> for her valuable feedback</li> <li><strong>Jennifer Hammelman</strong> for inspiration through Project SHORT</li> <li><strong>Campus organizations</strong>: WICS UCI, Artificial Intelligence at UCI, ACM@UCI, @Data @ UCI, UCI ANTrepreneur Center</li> </ul> <h2 id="future-expansion">Future Expansion</h2> <p>Our vision extends beyond UC Irvine. We aim to expand this resource to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Other California universities</strong></li> <li><strong>Universities across the United States</strong></li> <li><strong>Additional information</strong>: Faculty Google Scholar pages, Twitter accounts, and latest research updates</li> </ul> <h2 id="call-to-action">Call to Action</h2> <p>We need help from the community to:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Curate lists for other schools</strong> (deadlines are approaching!)</li> <li><strong>Add faculty information</strong>: Google Scholar links, Twitter accounts, latest research</li> <li><strong>Share with networks</strong>: Help spread the word to prospective students</li> </ul> <p><strong>Interested in contributing to DEI efforts in graduate education?</strong> Please reach out to me at <strong>nnagesh1@uci.edu</strong>.</p> <h2 id="technical-implementation">Technical Implementation</h2> <p>The resource is built using:</p> <ul> <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for easy access and collaboration</li> <li><strong>Markdown format</strong> for simple editing and maintenance</li> <li><strong>Open source approach</strong> to encourage community contributions</li> <li><strong>Structured data</strong> for easy navigation and search</li> </ul> <h2 id="looking-forward">Looking Forward</h2> <p>This project represents more than just a resource—it’s about <strong>breaking down barriers</strong> in graduate education and creating pathways for talented students from all backgrounds to pursue advanced degrees in computer science.</p> <p>By making information more accessible, we’re not just helping individual students; we’re contributing to a more diverse and innovative future for the field of computer science.</p> <hr/> <p><em>This post was originally shared on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nitish-nagesh_github-nitish-nageshuci-ics-phd-positions-activity-7272841692670533633-a3Rp">LinkedIn</a> and has been adapted for this blog.
