I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences, UC Irvine, advised by Prof. Amir M. Rahmani.

My research focuses on **causal inference**, **generative AI**, and **large language models** for real-world healthcare. I build tools that aim to make AI fair, explainable, and clinically useful.

I've published in venues like *IEEE Medicine & Biology* and *Elsevier Smart Health*, and my current work includes building causally fair synthetic data pipelines and LLM-powered diet coaching agents.

I'm fluent in Python, R, SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and LangChain. I enjoy developing end-to-end AI applications — from data engineering to model deployment.

My research interests include:
- **Causal Inference**: Building causally fair synthetic data pipelines and causal analysis on healthcare data
- **Generative AI**: Large language models for healthcare and LLM-powered conversational agents  
- **Machine Learning**: Fairness in AI, explainable AI, and healthcare applications
