I am interested in trustworthy and explainable AI for health applications.

As a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at UC Irvine, I specialize in fairness-aware causal inference and large language models for health applications. My research has been published in top-tier venues like IEEE Medicine & Biology and Elsevier Smart Health, American Heart Association, and the American Diabetes Association.

I am the recipient of UC Irvine's Beall Family Entrepreneur Award, the TU Munich Young Academy Scholarship, and the Best Outgoing Student award in Electrical Engineering at R.V. College.

I have expertise in Python, R, SQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, and LangChain.

Outside of work, I enjoy science communication and mentoring people from diverse backgrounds.
